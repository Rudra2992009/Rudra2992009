I'm a passionate developer with a deep interest in the intersection of technology and creativity. My journey has been defined by my constant exploration of new tools and my love for solving complex problems. I believe in the power of code to build, innovate, and make a real-world impact.
My Journey with AI Pair Programming
For the past 5-6 years, I've had the incredible experience of working side-by-side with over 100 different AI and scratch tools. This journey has transformed my approach to development, making me more efficient, more creative, and a better problem-solver.
I've used AI for:
 * Code Generation: From simple boilerplate to complex algorithms.
 * Debugging & Analysis: Pinpointing errors and suggesting optimizations.
 * Creative Brainstorming: Generating ideas for new projects and features.
 * Automated Testing: Creating and running test suites with incredible speed.
